We will not be accepting any files via email as per GDPR policy.\nWhat do you need to consider?\nPlease note below while processing the payroll instructions through the payroll system.\n- In the \"to be processed\" tab column Q states which items are to be paid to the assignee (\"Pay\") and which items are not to be paid (\"No Pay\"). Those items are for reporting purposes only. Where applicable tax items would be flagged as Taxes in col Q.\n- Please note, that the net pay only includes all balance sheet payments provided to us by the AstraZeneca. If there are local payments being made through the payroll which are not included in the payroll instruction, then those would not be included in the net pay stated by EY. In these cases the net pay will differ from the EY pay instruction to the payslip accordingly. The logic we have applied for deduction codes is that they are appearing as negative. If your payroll system has the codes set up as deduction please reverse and import these payments as a positive amount to ensure the assignee is deducted accordingly.\nHow to read the pay instruction?\nThe payroll instruction file has 4 tabs, information is detailed below:\n- Summary - breakdown of the total net pay and taxes to be paid over to the tax authorities\n- To be processed - detailed breakdown of all payments contained within the payroll instruction\n- Net Pay - breakdown by assignee of individual net pay\n- Key - IMPORTANT, this provides information on how to process each column within the to be processed tab of the payroll instruction\nWhat are the deadlines?\nThe deadline for processing these instructions and to provide the results (payslips and payroll system report) is by 31st July 2019.\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out to us immediately in case of any questions or queries.", "intent": "Intentxxx", "entities": [{"entity": "EmployeeId", "start": 3483, "end": 3491, "value": "20182710"}, {"entity": "ActionVerb", "start": 2115, "end": 2126, "value": "let us know"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 1864, "end": 1868, "value": "July"}, {"entity": "ActionVerb", "start": 1759, "end": 1766, "value": "confirm"}, {"entity": "EmployeeId", "start": 1738, "end": 1746, "value": "20146800"}, {"entity": "EmployeeId", "start": 1008, "end": 1016, "value": "90200472"}, {"entity": "EffectiveDate", "start": 997, "end": 1007, "value": "01.03.2019"}, {"entity": "EmployeeId", "start": 965, "end": 973, "value": "90200459"}, {"entity": "EmployeeName", "start": 757, "end": 770, "value": "Janine Gehrig"}, {"entity": "ActionVerb", "start": 673, "end": 684, "value": "let us know"}, {"entity": "ActionVerb", "start": 303, "end": 307, "value": "send"}]}, {"text": "team\nPlease process attached advance payment - EXPRESS transferrer", "intent": "Intentxxx", "entities": [{"entity": "PaymentType", "start": 29, "end": 44, "value": "advance payment"}, {"entity": "ActionVerb", "start": 12, "end": 19, "value": "process"}]}, {"text": "Please be informed that the account has been debited.\n\n[ID:10061853] **PLEASE SECURE FUNDS: **Croatia- bank file for July 2019\nDear Treasury Team,\nPlease secure the funds as per below.\nEmployee Pay Bank File:\nPayroll Country:\nCroatia\nSAP Company Code:\n6232\nCurrency:\nHRK\nPay Date:\n01/08/2019 [dd/mm/yyyy]\nTotal amount to be paid:\n1,115,869.74\nTax & Contributions Bank File:\nPayroll Country:\nCroatia\nSAP Company Code:\n6232\nCurrency:\nHRK\nPay Date:\n01/08/2019  [dd/mm/yyyy]\nTotal amount to be paid:\n1,046,987.04", "intent": "Intentxxx", "entities": [{"entity": "Amount", "start": 496, "end": 508, "value": "1,046,987.04"}, {"entity": "EffectiveDate", "start": 446, "end": 456, "value": "01/08/2019"}, {"entity": "Currency", "start": 432, "end": 435, "value": "HRK"}, {"entity": "Amount", "start": 330, "end": 342, "value": "1,115,869.74"}, {"entity": "EffectiveDate", "start": 281, "end": 291, "value": "01/08/2019"}, {"entity": "Currency", "start": 267, "end": 270, "value": "HRK"}, {"entity": "PayElementType", "start": 165, "end": 170, "value": "funds"}, {"entity": "TicketID", "start": 59, "end": 67, "value": "10061853"}]}, {"text": "[EXTERNAL EMAIL]\nPlease see the attached payment request for Matt Weimer.

This is always a problem to so many party trying to clear off those unknown open items or items remaining unable to clear in our book.\nIn this case regarding deposit from employee Ivan salary loan, it is related to above email trail. Below is my findings.\n@Wong, Sally I need your help on point number 4 below to verify the correctness of the proposed entry.\n@Ritaga, Aveguel (USABPO) this is related to payroll journal so it should be raised from your side.

We will not be accepting any files via email as per GDPR policy.\nWhat do you need to consider?\nPlease note below while processing the payroll instructions through the payroll system.\n- In the \"to be processed\" tab column Q states which items are to be paid to the assignee (\"Pay\") and which items are not to be paid (\"No Pay\"). Those items are for reporting purposes only. Where applicable tax items would be flagged as Taxes in col Q.\n- Please note, that the net pay only includes all balance sheet payments provided to us by the AstraZeneca. If there are local payments being made through the payroll which are not included in the payroll instruction, then those would not be included in the net pay stated by EY. In these cases the net pay will differ from the EY pay instruction to the payslip accordingly. The logic we have applied for deduction codes is that they are appearing as negative. If your payroll system has the codes set up as deduction please reverse and import these payments as a positive amount to ensure the assignee is deducted accordingly.\nHow to read the pay instruction?\nThe payroll instruction file has 4 tabs, information is detailed below:\n- Summary - breakdown of the total net pay and taxes to be paid over to the tax authorities\n- To be processed - detailed breakdown of all payments contained within the payroll instruction\n- Net Pay - breakdown by assignee of individual net pay\n- Key - IMPORTANT, this provides information on how to process each column within the to be processed tab of the payroll instruction\nWhat are the deadlines?\nThe deadline for processing these instructions and to provide the results (payslips and payroll system report) is by 31st July 2019.\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out to us immediately in case of any questions or queries.", "intent": "Intentxxx", "entities": [{"entity": "ActionVerb", "start": 6003, "end": 6012, "value": "July 2019"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 4200, "end": 4208, "value": "July2019"}, {"entity": "EmployeeId", "start": 4175, "end": 4183, "value": "20182710"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 3220, "end": 3224, "value": "July"}, {"entity": "ActionVerb", "start": 3162, "end": 3171, "value": "July 2019"}, {"entity": "ActionVerb", "start": 2871, "end": 2880, "value": "July 2019"}, {"entity": "ActionVerb", "start": 2789, "end": 2798, "value": "July 2019"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 2731, "end": 2742, "value": "August 2019"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 2556, "end": 2560, "value": "July"}, {"entity": "EmployeeId", "start": 2430, "end": 2438, "value": "20146800"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 2339, "end": 2348, "value": "July 2019"}, {"entity": "EmployeeId", "start": 1700, "end": 1708, "value": "90200472"}, {"entity": "EffectiveDate", "start": 1689, "end": 1699, "value": "01.03.2019"}, {"entity": "EmployeeId", "start": 1657, "end": 1665, "value": "90200459"}, {"entity": "EmployeeName", "start": 1449, "end": 1462, "value": "Janine Gehrig"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 1340, "end": 1351, "value": "August 2019"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 1200, "end": 1211, "value": "August 2019"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 420, "end": 426, "value": "July19"}, {"entity": "EmployeeId", "start": 340, "end": 348, "value": "90200460"}]}, {"text": "Armie,\nPlease exit U5 payroll PP32  as soon as the penny is removed from PERNR 51000908.", "intent": "Intentxxx", "entities": [{"entity": "EmployeeId", "start": 79, "end": 87, "value": "51000908"}, {"entity": "ActionVerb", "start": 14, "end": 18, "value": "exit"}]}, {"text": "This bonus was not rescinded through interface, please remove all payments for John Mosack and provide new SIM.", "intent": "Intentxxx", "entities": [{"entity": "ActionVerb", "start": 95, "end": 102, "value": "provide"}, {"entity": "EmployeeName", "start": 79, "end": 90, "value": "John Mosack"}, {"entity": "ActionVerb", "start": 55, "end": 61, "value": "remove"}]}, {"text": "team\nPlease process attached advance payment", "intent": "Intentxxx", "entities": [{"entity": "PaymentType", "start": 29, "end": 44, "value": "advance payment"}, {"entity": "ActionVerb", "start": 12, "end": 19, "value": "process"}]}, {"text": "Please forward directly to payroll: Arbeitsbescheinigung Shabnam Sirwani\nFor Payroll (APM)\nDear colleagues,\nplease find attached the template for the finalisation of the \"Arbeitsbescheinigung\" for Shabnam Sirwani.\nKindly send the Arbeitsbescheinigung back to PeopleHR.DE@maersk.com.\nThe password is the one for August 2019.", "intent": "Intentxxx", "entities": [{"entity": "EmployeeName", "start": 197, "end": 212, "value": "Shabnam Sirwani"}, {"entity": "EmployeeName", "start": 57, "end": 72, "value": "Shabnam Sirwani"}]}, {"text": "Re-sending this under a new ticket number as the previously generated one was closed.\n\n[EXTERNAL]  [ID:10106156] CR late data July 2019\nDate: Tue, Aug 6, 2019 10:41 PM\nDear Team,\nPlease find attached Local CR for the late data in July 2019.\nKindly reach out to Sarianne Siirila or Oliver Plueghan for any clarifications.\n\n[EXTERNAL]  [ID:10106156] CR late data July 2019\nDate: Thu, Jul 18, 2019 9:58 PM\nHi Jesús,\nplease find attached the CR for late data July 2019.\n\n[ID:10106156] CR late data July 2019\nThis message was sent from outside of your organization.

By Standard design (not customizable), it cannot be filtered.\nSaid that, we should then go to solution proposed yesterday for the list of WT:\n- 1. Technical configuration to block the integration from HRX to euHReka\n- 2. To create the WT filed in HRX Exchange (mapped with euHReka) such a way Corning HR can record the values to be taken into account for payroll purpose.\nIn attachment, I have described the current and expected mapping.\nIn order to evaluate formally the changes to be applies, in attachment, you will find 2 columns where NGA need an input (action 1 and 2):\n- Action 1: should we adapt the FR label?\n- Action 2: we want to be sure the given WT is the one used in Payroll, and that there is not another WT design for PY Purpose. Example: yesterday Agnes and Céline mentioned WT2007 and WT2011.\nAs agreed I propose a meeting to go through by next week.\n\nExclude Fixed Bonus and NRP in NGA interface / Meeting minutes\n[EXTERNAL EMAIL]\nHello to All,\nBelow you can find the actions we have discussed today:\n- ASR went through correctly in payroll except for 4 employees with LTI payment. Celine will correct salary data based on TB salary report, no additional ticket is needed.\n- Fixed bonus: works correctly. It's entered for every New Hire and flows into HRX, but it is not interfaced into payroll. HTR to control that data doesn't flow into payroll.\n- New retention bonus has to be added to the below NRP Wage types.\n- Request will be submitted to change French label of NRP Wage types for Corning to ensure alignment in French wording with other Corning French Businesses.\n- NRP Compensation data shows a forecast in TB, it shouldn't go through HRX since it doesn't drive payroll.\n- Laurent to check with technical team, whether NRP Wage types can have a Dummy code not to be passed into payroll\n- HTR will submit NRP Wage types in Payment and Deduction input file and payroll reports and payslip will be used for data validation.\n- Organize follow-up meeting to discuss technical feasibility.\n- Thorough testing is required for this interface functionality. Targeted go-live: August\nPlease feel free to add/correct the above meeting minutes.\n\nExclude Fixed Bonus and NRP in NGA interface\nHi,\nSorry in advance for the long email, but the request raises important questions for the data model.\nFirst of all I update the list of the 11 wagetypes concerned in the discussion:\nJean document\nNGA configuration\nCode Rubrique\nLibellé rubrique (25 charactères max.)\nCORNING EC CODE\nWT Code\nFrench Label\nEnglish Label\nComment\n2007\nCash Award Global\nCAG\n2007\nBonus M+1\nRename: Cash Award Global\n2008\nPIP\n2008\nBonus M+2\nRename: PIP\n2006\nLong Term Incentive\nLTI\n2006\nBonus Garanti\nRename: Long Term Incentive\n2036\nHousing Allowance\n?\n2036\nAide à la mobilité géographique\nRename: Housing Allowance\n2013\nNon-Cash Award\nNCA\n2013\nChèques cadeaux\nRename: Non-Cash Award\n2022\nSign on bonus\nSGN\n2022\nInd.

The expected process is:\n- The WT values are not transferred to euHReka\n- Corning Team opens ticket to request to upload the values expected in euHReka\n-\n- Change and Concern raised by the Corning request\nThe Corning request is technically possible: the 11 WT are configurated in the integration table HRX-euHReka \"To be skipped\". Then the data is not recorded in euHReka.\nThe cost is 1 day: 0,5 day technical changes - 0.5 day testing\nPlease note that we need to understand the frequency of the entries in euHReka expected to evaluate the cost.\nOur main concern is the data master policy.\nOn HRX model, HRX is master and euHReka PY is slave.\nThe policy to manage directly data in euHReka is when the WT do not exist in HRX.\nThat means Corning will have a structural Gap between the values associated to codes between 2 systems, assuming the slave solution (euHReka)\n-\n- Alternative approach\nThe NGA logic is to have Corning recording data in EC or on HRX directly. And then it flows to euHReka. The policy is to respect the logic HRX Master, euHReka Slave for data.\nThe proposal is to create in HRX a copy of the existing WT but with a different code. EC file is set up to point on this new code.\nWe map EC with a new WT code in HRX\nWe use the existing WT code in HRX when Corning wants to enter value for Payroll.\nExample:\nCode Rubrique\nLibellé rubrique (25 charactères max.)\nCORNING EC CODE\nWT Code\nFrench Label\nEnglish Label\nComment\n2007\nCash Award Global\nCAG\n2007\nBonus M+1\nRename: Cash Award Global\nFor Exchange to euHReka\n20A7\nCash Award Global (B)\nCAG\n20A7\nBonus M+1\nRename: Cash Award Global (B)\nFor EC to Exchange (B)\nFlow EC à HRX: CAG (EC) is mapped 20A7 (WT HRX code to be created)\nFlow HRX à euHReka: Corning HR do the records on HRX on WT2700 which is mapped with euHReka\nThis way the Corning HR Team can manage the data for PY since HRX.\nWe will go through during the meeting, but feel free to provide in advance your feedback.", "intent": "Intentxxx", "entities": [{"entity": "PayElementType", "start": 8031, "end": 8037, "value": "WT2700"}, {"entity": "PayElementType", "start": 7948, "end": 7954, "value": "WT HRX"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 4555, "end": 4561, "value": "August"}, {"entity": "PayElementType", "start": 3338, "end": 3349, "value": "Fixed Bonus"}, {"entity": "PayElementType", "start": 3263, "end": 3269, "value": "WT2011"}, {"entity": "PayElementType", "start": 3252, "end": 3258, "value": "WT2007"}, {"entity": "PayElementType", "start": 1747, "end": 1758, "value": "Fixed Bonus"}, {"entity": "EmployeeName", "start": 1251, "end": 1257, "value": "Céline"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 1100, "end": 1106, "value": "August"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 1081, "end": 1085, "value": "July"}, {"entity": "PayElementType", "start": 725, "end": 736, "value": "Fixed Bonus"}, {"entity": "TicketID", "start": 470, "end": 477, "value": "9796311"}, {"entity": "TicketID", "start": 57, "end": 64, "value": "9796311"}]}, {"text": "Please find attached the July monthly payroll figures for PES.

Please let me know if you could provide a breakdown of the amount that was payed (tax, hours worked, any other deductions etc.). Would there be any difference in my pay, as an Indian citizen (international student)?\nAdditionally, I have an issue with the following week's timesheet. I was not aware that I would be paid for my 1st week (since no times had been entered into Kronos timesheet), so we entered a total of 80 hours for the following week (July 22nd to 26th).

Would it be alright to consult with you?\nPlease know that my supervisor Sujata is also cc'ed in this email.\nI wanted to clarify the details regarding my pay, since I checked my bank account recently and found some inconsistencies:\nAs you know from the previous email, I was not able to enter my times for my first week (July 15th to 19th) - yet, I still received a paycheck for that week. However, the amount did not match what I would have received for the 40 hours that I worked. Please let me know if I am mistaken about the amount (and if so, why). I was paid $630.49 (at $20/hour) for 40 hours.\nAs Sujata mentioned in the email, we entered my first week's hours in the following pay period (2 weeks between July 22nd and Aug 2nd). This meant that my last pay period had a total of 120 hours (3 weeks). I have not yet received my paycheck for this. So I am missing my paycheck for at least 2 weeks.\nSince the first week was (at least partially) paid, there needs to be some changes made to the total. Please let me know if I could be of assistance in any way.\nThank you very much,\nWarm\n\nTimesheet for Nimmy- week ending 7/26/2019\nInformation Classification: llLimited Access\n\nTimesheet for Nimmy- week ending 7/26/2019\nInformation Classification: llLimited Access\nHi Jeremy, as you know Nimmy started one week later than the rest of the interns, she was not able to her time for the week of 7/15-7/19. As such I went in and added 16 hours for the week ending 7/26/2019. I hope she gets paid for the 80 hours.

At no time up to my leaving\nof AstraZeneca or prior to receiving the PILON payments, was any attempt\nmade to rectify any mis-communication to me. It should also be noted that\nthe PILON process mentioned by both yourself and Sharon was not readily\navailable, at my time of leaving, to AstraZeneca employees on MYHR intranet.\nMy understanding is that the PILON payment is an agreement between the\ncompany and employee, when the Company wishes to breach it's terms of\ncontract with an employee ie choosing to ask me to leave without being\nprovided with notice period detailed in the contract (7 months in my\ncase). The PILON compensation is agreed based on the information and\nclarity provided by HR. In my case, it was clearly stated that I would\nreceived holiday accrual pay up to 12 February 2020.

Consequently, I sent mine over late, had not been assigned a tax code and had unexpectedly been taxed. Since then I've received an e-mail saying my new starter checklist has been processed. If you could provide me my new tax code I can contact HMRC about getting the money I was taxed reimbursed.\nHowever, some of the other IP students who submitted there P45/new starter checklist on time and were not taxed instead had a student finance England (SFE) loan repayment on their payslips, despite our annual income being well under the threshold to be repaying this. Consequently, myself and many other IP's are a little confused about what happened here. I suspect this is because with the 'Joining Bonus' of £750 for the first month pushed our monthly pay higher than the £2,143 threshold for SFE repayments. After contacting SFE many got told to contact HR, so I'd also like to double check that I won't have a SFE repayment on my payslip this August.\nMany thanks,\nNicholas Smith\nComments and Work notes:\n2019-08-09 13:06:03 UTC - Hetty MallettWork notes\nHi, please can you advise if you have received any notification from Student Loans to deduct in August for Nicholas Smith", "intent": "Intentxxx", "entities": [{"entity": "EmployeeName", "start": 1827, "end": 1841, "value": "Nicholas Smith"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 1816, "end": 1822, "value": "August"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 1609, "end": 1615, "value": "August"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 414, "end": 420, "value": "August"}, {"entity": "PayrollMonth", "start": 405, "end": 409, "value": "July"}, {"entity": "EmployeeName", "start": 390, "end": 404, "value": "Mallett, Hetty"}, {"entity": "EmployeeId", "start": 301, "end": 309, "value": "20644160"}, {"entity": "EmployeeName", "start": 237, "end": 252, "value": "Smith, Nicholas"}]}, {"text": "In order to provide an update for this task / case, please reply back to this email.\nPlease do not remove the Ticket-ID / Reference  Number and do not modify the format of these.

Any further manipulation of the file could result in the proper tax rate not being used.\nAttached is a file with employees who have shares vesting on August 15th. This vesting will include the processing of Deferred Stock Awards (DSA), SSGA LTIP Awards, and Deferred Value Awards (DVAs). We have included anestimate of the income that will be realized for each employee upon vesting. This is calculated using an estimated stock price and estimated FX rate - this is only provided so that it may help with the tax rate confirmation prior to the vest date. These valueswill change upon the final vesting and shouldNOT be used to process. Final income information will be provided after the vesting has been completed.\nDeferred Stock Award process:\nAll employees worldwide will be processed as a 'withhold to cover'. In this transaction, the Company will retain enough of an employee's vesting shares to satisfy their personal tax obligation and employees will receive the net shares in their brokerage account. In a withhold to cover process, the same price is used to calculate an employee's income and tax obligation as well as to determine the amount of shares needed to cover the tax obligation.\nIn order to comply with strict accounting standards for global equity plans, we must insure that the tax withholding rate for each employee is based on the minimum required tax withholding rate under local tax rules. If no tax withholding is required then the rate is 0. If the minimum required tax withholding is based on year-to-date earnings then you will need to incorporate this into the rate provided.\nSSGA LTIP & Deferred Value Awards:\nSimilar to the vesting of other equity types, State Street will need to withhold the appropriate amount of taxes and the Equity Administration group will wire the tax withholding to the employees respective payrolls for the appropriate withholding and reporting. These tax rates could differ from the tax withholding rates for DSA's. The net cash payments will be deposited into employees Fidelity accounts.\nAs a reminder, for all awards we withhold taxes in a particular location using a universal rate that has been supplied to us by KPMG. We have supplied a listing of employees from your payroll that are vesting in August, along with the current KPMG rate that has been provided. For each employee, please confirm the correct actual minimum required rate withheld in order to comply with local tax regulations. PLEASE NOTE: The calculation used to determine the shares needed to satisfy an employee's tax obligation usually results in a fractional amount of shares. Since the Company can only withhold whole amounts, the fractional amount is rounded up resulting in a small portion of extra funds being withheld.
